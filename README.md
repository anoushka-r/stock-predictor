# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Networks
# 
#### Overview
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of artificial recurrent neural network, to predict the closing stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). By analyzing the past 60 days of stock price data, the model aims to forecast future prices, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.

#### Objectives
- **Historical Data Utilization**: Analyze and process past 60 days of Apple Inc. stock price data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Model Development**: Develop an LSTM-based neural network tailored for time series prediction.
- **Future Prediction**: Generate predictions for stock prices up to 100 days into the future, offering a glimpse into potential market movements.

#### Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    - Source historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the `pandas_datareader` library.
    - Visualize the closing price history to understand trends.
    - Filter the data to include only the 'Close' column and convert it to a numpy array.
    - Scale the data using MinMaxScaler to normalize the values between 0 and 1.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

2. **Training Data Preparation**:
    - Create training datasets (`x_train` and `y_train`) by splitting the scaled data into sequences of 60 days to predict the 61st day.
    - Reshape the training data to fit the LSTM model's input requirements.

3. **LSTM Network Design**:
    - Construct an LSTM network with two LSTM layers and dense layers to capture temporal dependencies and make predictions.
    - Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Train the LSTM model on the training dataset for one epoch with a batch size of one.
    - Create testing datasets (`x_test` and `y_test`) and reshape them for model prediction.
    - Generate predictions using the trained model and inverse transform the scaled predictions to original values.
    - Evaluate the model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Future Price Prediction**:
    - Extend the model to predict future stock prices up to 100 days beyond the available data.
    - Generate future predictions iteratively by using the last predicted value as input for the next prediction.

6. **Visualization and Analysis**:
    - Plot the training data, validation data, and model predictions to visualize the performance.
    - Plot the future predicted prices alongside historical data for a comprehensive view.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, yfinance, pandas_datareader, scikit-learn
- **Platform**: Google Colab for computational resources and ease of use

#### Significance
Predicting stock prices with a high degree of accuracy is a challenging yet essential task in the financial industry. This project demonstrates the practical application of LSTM networks in time series forecasting, offering a foundation for further exploration into more complex predictive models. Accurate stock price predictions can aid investors in making informed decisions, potentially leading to improved investment strategies and financial outcomes.

#### Future Work
- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features such as trading volume, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment analysis to enrich the model's input data.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Develop a pipeline for real-time stock price predictions, integrating live data feeds and automated trading systems.

This project encapsulates a robust approach to stock price prediction, showcasing the capabilities of LSTM networks in capturing and forecasting financial market trends.
